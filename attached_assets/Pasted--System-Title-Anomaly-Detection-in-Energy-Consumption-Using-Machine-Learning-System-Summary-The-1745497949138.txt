✅ System Title
Anomaly Detection in Energy Consumption Using Machine Learning

🎯 System Summary
The platform will detect unusual patterns in energy consumption using machine learning. It should be visually rich, intuitive, responsive, and fully functional offline. The aim is to present insights through clean, interactive visuals rather than long text.

🔐 Login Page
Professional design with a clean layout and subtle energy-themed imagery

Fields: Username & Password

Optional: “Remember Me” checkbox

Successful login redirects to the Dashboard

🧭 Sidebar Navigation (Collapsible + Icon-Based)
Sidebar should be minimal and intuitive, including:

Dashboard – Real-time graphs and summary stats

Upload Data – Upload energy usage datasets

Run Detection – Execute selected ML models

Results – Visual representation of detected anomalies

Model Insights – Charts showing model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)

Recommendations – AI-based suggestions for optimizing energy use

Settings – Theme toggle, thresholds, system controls

📊 Visualization Requirements
Interactive line charts for energy data with:

Red dots or shaded zones highlighting anomalies

Additional charts (bar, heatmap, scatter) where helpful

Charts should be created using Plotly, D3.js, or Chart.js

Focus is on visuals — minimize explanatory text

🖼️ Design & Imagery
Modern UI with a professional theme

Rounded corners, smooth transitions, consistent fonts

Use of energy-related imagery/icons (e.g., solar panels, electricity grids) within:

Dashboard headers

Section banners

Sidebar or content backgrounds

Responsive across desktop and mobile

⚙️ Backend (Flask + ML)
Flask-powered, fully offline setup

Users can:

Upload CSV files

Trigger model analysis (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, K-Means)

View anomaly results with clear visuals

Review model metrics in graph form

Receive system-generated recommendations
